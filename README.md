# Simple-Python-Calculator
A command-line-based calculator written in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project is designed to demonstrate how to create a simple yet functional calculator with options to reset or terminate the program.

## Features

ðŸš€Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), power (^), and remainder (%).

ðŸš€Reset Option: Use $ to reset the calculator and start over.

ðŸš€Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and division by zero gracefully.

ðŸš€User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear instructions and feedback for each step.

## How It Works

1.The program prompts the user to select an operation from the available options.

2.The user inputs two numbers for the chosen operation.

3.The program performs the calculation and displays the result.

4.The user can reset the calculator or terminate the program at any time.
